## Creep 

A software project is always in danger of becoming an "everything and nothing"
project, where different, often unspoken goals and priorities pile onto the
developer schedule. The "real" goals of a project might get lost, while "flavor
of the day" goals occupy the time and attention of developers and leadership. 

This might happen both during and after planning, but it's less likely for projects that have been properly planned, with codified plans and shared understanding of the purpose and scope of the project. Protection from 
<span class="term">feature creep</span> 
is one of the most important benefits of proper planning. 

While i have also written quite a lot about the importance of flexibility, one
of the most important skills required for project navigation is being able to
discern between those emergent goals that are worthy of pursuit, and those that
are simply distractions. This is a lot harder than one might initially think.
